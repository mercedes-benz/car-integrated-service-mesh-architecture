# PRISMA Study

This directory contains the scripts and (intermediate) results for the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) study conducted as part of the PhD project related to this repository. To avoid potential copyright issues, we removed the retrieved data from the CSV files but kept the identifiers/URLs; a '-' indicates a publication that is not a single article, e.g., a conference proceedings.

Moreover, the scripts depend on the official Python implementation of the IEEE Xplore API.
